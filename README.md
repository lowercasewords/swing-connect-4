Hello! This is a thing I made for really no aparent reason. Currently the game is in early beta version and will probably stay in in for the dawn of time. I don't really like the idea of using an old technology to build a game that already exists! Took me a long time to build as well for some reason? 

As if today, the program is half-done. Visuals are not really there, half of classes are not used. The existing classes are half implemented.

Running this thing in replit in quirky because my conf file is not done too. Mainly because I...don't use replit...
