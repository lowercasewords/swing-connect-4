Hello! This is a thing I made for really no aparent reason. Currently the game is in early beta version and will probably stay in in for the dawn of time. I don't really like the idea of using an old technology to build a game that already exists! Took me a long time to build as well, and I think it should have taken me 2 weeks? 

As if today, the program is half-done. Visuals are not really there, half of classes are not used. The existing classes are half implemented. But I have commented most of the code, a few of them might be outdated ones btw...

If I ever will finish the project, I will add following improvements:
- Implementation of ScoreBoard using MySql database
- Addition and improvement and  of visuals
- Renewed code and comments
- Replit config fixed
- Usable jar file
- <b>Anyting else I forgot to mention!</b>

This project tries to replicate the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller) for the first time, so it might look a bit weird. Basically <i>Model</i> is independed of other parts, <i>View</i> stores the <i>Model</i> and has methods for displaying the visuals, and <i>Controller</i> stores and calls upon both <i>Model</i> and View</i>.

Jar file doesn't work and I don't feel like fixing it honeslty.

Running this thing in replit in quirky because my conf '.replit' file is not done too. Mainly because I... never use replit for developing, VS Code is addicting.
